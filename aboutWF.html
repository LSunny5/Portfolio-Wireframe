                <p class="bio tab"> 
                    Being an avid puzzle lover since she was a toddler, Sunny has always loved solving problems, paying attention to detail, and creating things with her hands.  She has a Masters in Software Engineering and is currently in the Bloc/Thinkful Web Development Program.  Coding has always been a hobby and she is excited to turn it into a profession.  Her other hobbies include reading, racquet sports (ping pong and tennis), hiking, tech, and of course puzzles.  She also fancies anything Disney, spending time with her kids, husband, and teaching the pet cat to do tricks.  Thanks for stopping by and feel free to explore and checkout her projects!
